## Disclaimer

The objective of the IOOS Compliance Checker is to check your file against our interpretation of select dataset metadata standards to use as a guideline in generating compliant files.
The compliance checker should not be considered the authoritative source on whether your file is 100% "compliant".
Instead, we recommend that users use the results as a guide to work towards compliance.
